- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, My name is Chelsea Muhwati and i am an industrial engineering student in my 3rd year at the University of Toronto.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Ai and Machine learning as well as Data Science. I have done many projects that i throughly enjoyed.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about Data modelling and Data Engineering, as well as advancing my skills in SQL

  These are some of my projects from MIE223, a data sceince course I took in 2023 at the Univeristy of Toronto. I was able to learn various skills such as
  data cleaning, sentiment analysis, bayesian data modelling..ect. This skills have helped me understand how to work with data and making sure it is usable.
